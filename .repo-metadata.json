  "api_description": "is designed to provide reliable, many-to-many, asynchronous messaging between applications. Publisher\\napplications can send messages to a topic and other applications can\\nsubscribe to that topic to receive the messages. By decoupling senders and\\nreceivers, Google Cloud Pub/Sub allows developers to communicate between\\nindependently written applications.\\n\\nCompared to Google Pub/Sub, Pub/Sub Lite provides partitioned zonal data\\nstorage with predefined capacity. Both products present a similar API, but\\nPub/Sub Lite has more usage caveats.\\n\\nSee the [Google Pub/Sub Lite docs](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/quickstart-console#before-you-begin) for more details on how to activate\\nPub/Sub Lite for your project, as well as guidance on how to choose between\\nCloud Pub/Sub and Pub/Sub Lite.",
