// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND CLASS.
/**
 * Service Description: The service that a publisher client application uses to publish messages to
 * topics. Published messages are retained by the service for the duration of the retention period
 * configured for the respective topic, and are delivered to subscriber clients upon request (via
 * the `SubscriberService`).
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (PublisherServiceClient publisherServiceClient = PublisherServiceClient.create()) {
 *   BidiStream<PublishRequest, PublishResponse> bidiStream =
 *       publisherServiceClient.publishCallable().call();
 *   PublishRequest request = PublishRequest.newBuilder().build();
 *   bidiStream.send(request);
 *   for (PublishResponse response : bidiStream) {
 *     // Do something when a response is received.
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the PublisherServiceClient object to clean up resources
 * such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls
 * close().
 *
 * <table>
 *    <caption>Methods</caption>
 *    <tr>
 *      <th>Method</th>
 *      <th>Description</th>
 *      <th>Method Variants</th>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *      <td><p> Publish</td>
 *      <td><p> Establishes a stream with the server for publishing messages. Once the stream is initialized, the client publishes messages by sending publish requests on the stream. The server responds with a PublishResponse for each PublishRequest sent by the client, in the same order that the requests were sent. Note that multiple PublishRequests can be in flight simultaneously, but they will be processed by the server in the order that they are sent by the client on a given stream.</td>
 *      <td>
 *      <p>Callable method variants take no parameters and return an immutable API callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *           <li><p> publishCallable()
 *      </ul>
 *       </td>
 *    </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of PublisherServiceSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * PublisherServiceSettings publisherServiceSettings =
 *     PublisherServiceSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * PublisherServiceClient publisherServiceClient =
 *     PublisherServiceClient.create(publisherServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * PublisherServiceSettings publisherServiceSettings =
 *     PublisherServiceSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * PublisherServiceClient publisherServiceClient =
 *     PublisherServiceClient.create(publisherServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
