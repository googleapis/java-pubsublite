# Getting Started with Pub/Sub Lite Samples

## Running samples and tests using Cloud Shell

[Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) has application default credentials from its compute instance which will allow you to run an integration test without having to obtain `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.

However, tests require an additional environment variable `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER` to run. For instance, 
 
In [`UpdateTopicExampleIT.java`](snippets/src/test/java/pubsublite/UpdateTopicExampleIT.java):

```java
private static final String GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER =
       System.getenv("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER");
```
Here, the program needs you to provide your [Google Cloud Project Number](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) in an environment variable.

To run a sample's integration test in Cloud Shell:

1. `cd samples/snippets` - all samples are located in `java-pubsublite/samples/snippets` directory.

1. `mvn clean -Dtest=QuickStartIT test` - this runs the integration test for `UpdateTopicExample.java`.

To run a sample, update the developer's TODO section in the snippet, then:

1. `cd samples/snippets` - all samples are located in `java-pubsublite/samples/snippets` directory.

1. `mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=pubsublite.ListTopicsExample` - this should list the topics in your project.
